abstract = {The passivation of uranium surfaces against air corrosion, by ion implantation processes was studied, using surface analysis methods. Implanting 45 keV N+2 and C+ ions produces thin modified surface layers with gradual gradients of the corresponding compounds (i.e., nitrides and carbides, respectively), which avoid the formation of discontinuous interfaces typical to coatings. Such gradual interfaces impart excellent mechanical stability and adhesion to the modified layers, in spite of the large misfit between the metal substrate and the implantation on induced compounds. It turns out that these layers provide an almost absolute protection against air corrosion. A rapid initial stage of oxidation of the modified surface layers takes place, forming very thin protective oxidation zones (1–4 nm thick), which practically stop further air oxidation for years. The mechanism of the initial oxidation stage of the modified layers seems to vary with the type of surface (i.e., either nitrides or carbides). However, in any case the protection ability of the formed oxidation products is excellent, probably due to the close match between these compounds and the underlying nitrides or carbides.},

abstract = {The reaction mechanism and kinetics of the thermal decomposition of uranium dinitride/uranium sesquinitride to uranium mononitride under inert atmosphere at elevated temperature were studied. An increase in the lattice parameter of the UN2/$\alpha$-U2N3 phase was observed as the reaction temperature increased, corresponding to a continuous removal of nitrogen. Electron density calculations for these two compounds using XRD powder patterns of the samples utilizing charge-flipping technique were performed for the first time to visualize the decrease in nitrogen level as a function of temperature. Complete decomposition of UN2 into $\alpha$-U2N3 at 675 °C and the UN formation after a partial decomposition of $\alpha$-U2N3 at 975 °C were also identified in this study. The activation energy for the decomposition of the UN2/$\alpha$-U2N3 phase into UN, 423.8 ± 0.3 kJ/mol (101.3 kcal/mol), was determined under an inert argon atmosphere and is reported here experimentally for the first time.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTIn this study, the oxidation of various accident tolerant fuel candidates produced under different conditions have been evaluated and compared relative to the reference standard – UO2. The candidates considered in this study were UN, U3Si2, U3Si5, and a composite material composed of UN–U3Si2. With the spark plasma sintering (SPS) method, it was possible to fabricate samples of UN with varying porosity, as well as a high-density composite of UN–U3Si2 (10{\%}). Using thermogravimetry in air, the oxidation behaviors of each material and the various microstructures of UN were assessed. These results reveal that it is possible to fabricate UN to very high densities using the SPS method, such that its resistance to oxidation can be improved compared to U3Si5 and UO2, and compete favorably with the principal ATF candidates, U3Si2, which shows a particularly violent reaction under the conditions of this study, and the UN–U3Si2 (10{\%}) composite.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTIn this work, a systematic study of the degradation of UN pellets (density range 96{\%}–99.9{\%} and grain size of 6–24 µm) and UN-10{\%}U3Si2 (wt{\%}) composite in a steam environment is presented. Static steam autoclave tests were performed at 300 °C and 9 MPa for period of 0.5–1.5 hours. Microstructural analyses of UN pellets show that, in a high-pressure atmosphere, the fuel collapses principally by intergranular cracking generated by the precipitation of an oxide phase in the grain boundaries. This mechanism leads to a premature mechanical collapse of the fuel pellet, exposing fresh surfaces to steam, and ultimately accelerating the oxidation process. Increasing density (specifically eliminating open porosity) was found to delay the oxidation process, while increasing grain size was found to accelerate the degradation process due to a greater susceptibility to mechanical fracture by way of intergranular oxidation. The performance of the UN-10{\%}U3Si2 composite proved to be better when compared to UN. The U...},

Uranium nitride films with different nitrogen content, UNx (x = 0, 0.23, 0.68, 1.66), have been prepared on the Si substrate by radio frequency magnetron sputtering method. The experimental results showed that the UNx (x = 0, 0.23, 0.68, 1.66) films were fine and dense. The initial oxidation processes of uranium nitride films were investigated in an ultra-high vacuum chamber of Auger electron spectroscopy. After 105 L oxygen exposure, the oxide layer of UO2 were formed on the surface of U, and UN0.23, UN0.68 films formed UO2 with little UNxOy, while the UN1.66 film generated UNxOy oxide layer. UN1.66 film exhibited the thinnest oxide layer and provided the best considerable protection against oxygen attack. Also, the AES transition lines of UNxOy were identified for the first time.},

In this work, thermal decomposition of nitrogen-rich uranium nitride (denoted as UN2–x) under ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) conditions was investigated by thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). It has been shown that the nitrogen TDS spectrum consists of two peaks at about 723 and 1038 K. The X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron microscopy results indicate that UN2–x (UN2 phase) decomposed into the $\alpha$-U2N3 phase in the first step and the $\alpha$-U2N3 phase decomposed into the UN phase in the second step.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTUranium mononitride (UN) pellets of different densities were subjected to a superheated steam/argon mixture at atmospheric pressure to evaluate their resistance to hydrolysis. Complete degradation of pure UN pellets was obtained within 1 h in 0.50 bar steam at 500 °C. The identified reaction products were uranium dioxide, ammonia, and hydrogen gas, with no detectable amounts of nitrogen oxides formed. However, the reaction could not be carried to completion, and the presence of uranium sesquinitride and higher uranium oxides or uranium oxynitrides in the solid residue is indicated. Evolution of elemental nitrogen was seen in connection with very high reaction rates. The porosity of the pellets was identified as the most important factor determining reaction rates at 400–425 °C, and it is suggested that in dense pellets, cracking due to internal volume increase initiates a transition from slow surface corrosion to pellet disintegration.
