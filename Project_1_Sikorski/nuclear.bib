abstract = {ABSTRACTIn this work, a systematic study of the degradation of UN pellets (density range 96{\%}–99.9{\%} and grain size of 6–24 µm) and UN-10{\%}U3Si2 (wt{\%}) composite in a steam environment is presented. Static steam autoclave tests were performed at 300 °C and 9 MPa for period of 0.5–1.5 hours. Microstructural analyses of UN pellets show that, in a high-pressure atmosphere, the fuel collapses principally by intergranular cracking generated by the precipitation of an oxide phase in the grain boundaries. This mechanism leads to a premature mechanical collapse of the fuel pellet, exposing fresh surfaces to steam, and ultimately accelerating the oxidation process. Increasing density (specifically eliminating open porosity) was found to delay the oxidation process, while increasing grain size was found to accelerate the degradation process due to a greater susceptibility to mechanical fracture by way of intergranular oxidation. The performance of the UN-10{\%}U3Si2 composite proved to be better when compared to UN. The U...},

abstract = {The initial oxidation behaviors of uranium nitride films with different N/U ratios have been focused in the present work. Uranium nitride films with different nitrogen content, UNx (x = 0, 0.23, 0.68, 1.66), have been prepared on the Si substrate by radio frequency magnetron sputtering method. The experimental results showed that the UNx (x = 0, 0.23, 0.68, 1.66) films were fine and dense. The initial oxidation processes of uranium nitride films were investigated in an ultra-high vacuum chamber of Auger electron spectroscopy. After 105 L oxygen exposure, the oxide layer of UO2 were formed on the surface of U, and UN0.23, UN0.68 films formed UO2 with little UNxOy, while the UN1.66 film generated UNxOy oxide layer. UN1.66 film exhibited the thinnest oxide layer and provided the best considerable protection against oxygen attack. Also, the AES transition lines of UNxOy were identified for the first time.},

The initial oxidation behaviors of modified surfaces were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The SGPN on the uranium surface led to a single layer of uranium sesquinitride (U 2 N 3), while the PIII on the surface resulted in a compound layer composed of U 2 N 3 and uranium dioxide (UO 2). The oxygen covered on these modified layers led to the formation of UO 2 from U 2 N 3 and U 2 N 3 from UN. The oxidized nitrogen species were also observed on the two types of nitriding layers, with the discussion of the N–O coaction behaviors.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTUranium mononitride (UN) pellets of different densities were subjected to a superheated steam/argon mixture at atmospheric pressure to evaluate their resistance to hydrolysis. Complete degradation of pure UN pellets was obtained within 1 h in 0.50 bar steam at 500 °C. The identified reaction products were uranium dioxide, ammonia, and hydrogen gas, with no detectable amounts of nitrogen oxides formed. However, the reaction could not be carried to completion, and the presence of uranium sesquinitride and higher uranium oxides or uranium oxynitrides in the solid residue is indicated. Evolution of elemental nitrogen was seen in connection with very high reaction rates. The porosity of the pellets was identified as the most important factor determining reaction rates at 400–425 °C, and it is suggested that in dense pellets, cracking due to internal volume increase initiates a transition from slow surface corrosion to pellet disintegration. The implications for the use of nitride fuels in light water r...},

abstract = {Uranium nitrides are among the most promising fuels for Generation IV nuclear reactors, but until now, very little has been known about their thermal stability properties under nonequilibrium conditions. In this work, thermal decomposition of nitrogen-rich uranium nitride (denoted as UN2–x) under ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) conditions was investigated by thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). It has been shown that the nitrogen TDS spectrum consists of two peaks at about 723 and 1038 K. The X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron microscopy results indicate that UN2–x (UN2 phase) decomposed into the $\alpha$-U2N3 phase in the first step and the $\alpha$-U2N3 phase decomposed into the UN phase in the second step.},
