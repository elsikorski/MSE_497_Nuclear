	abstract = {The interfacial interaction of uranium mononitride (UN) with water from the environment unavoidably leads to corrosion of nuclear fuels, which affects a lot of processes in the nuclear fuel cycle. In this work, the microscopic adsorption behaviors of water on the UN(001) surface as well as water dissociation and accompanying H 2 formation mechanisms have been investigated on the basis of DFT+U calculations and ab initio atomistic thermodynamics. For adsorption of one H 2 O monomer, the predicted adsorption energies are {\`{A}}0.88, {\`{A}}2.07, and {\`{A}}2.07 eV for the most stable molecular, partially dissociative, and completely dissociative adsorption, respectively. According to our calculations, a water molecule dissociates into OH and H species via three pathways with small energy barriers of 0.78, 0.72, and 0.85 eV, respectively. With the aid of the neighboring H atom, H 2 formation through the reaction of H* + OH* can easily occur via two pathways with energy barriers of 0.61 and 0.36 eV, respectively. The molecular adsorption of water shows a slight coverage dependence on the surface while this dependence becomes obvious for partially dissociative adsorption as the water coverage increases from 1/4 to 1 ML. In addition, based on the ''ab initio atomistic thermodynamic'' simulations, increasing H 2 O partial pressure will enhance the stability of the adsorbed system and water coverage, while increasing temperature will decrease the H 2 O coverage. We found that the UN(001) surface reacts easily with H 2 O at room temperature, leading to dissolution and corrosion of the UN fuel materials.},

Oxygen adsorption, migration, incorporation into the surface N vacancies on (001) and (110) surfaces have been modeled using 2D slabs of different thicknesses and supercell sizes. The temperature dependences of the N vacancy formation energies and oxygen incorporation energies are calculated. We demonstrate that O atoms easily penetrate into UN surfaces and grain boundaries containing N vacancies, due to negative incorporation energies and a small energy barrier. The Gibbs free energies of N vacancy formation and O atom incorporation therein at the two densely-packed surfaces and tilt grain boundaries are compared. It has been also shown that the adsorbed oxygen atoms are highly mobile which, combined with easy incorporation into surface N vacancies, explains efficient (but unwanted) oxidation of UN surfaces. The atomistic mechanism of UN oxidation via possible formation of oxynitrides is discussed.},

@article{Arkush2000,
abstract = {The passivation of uranium surfaces against air corrosion, by ion implantation processes was studied, using surface analysis methods. Implanting 45 keV N+2 and C+ ions produces thin modified surface layers with gradual gradients of the corresponding compounds (i.e., nitrides and carbides, respectively), which avoid the formation of discontinuous interfaces typical to coatings. Such gradual interfaces impart excellent mechanical stability and adhesion to the modified layers, in spite of the large misfit between the metal substrate and the implantation on induced compounds. It turns out that these layers provide an almost absolute protection against air corrosion. A rapid initial stage of oxidation of the modified surface layers takes place, forming very thin protective oxidation zones (1–4 nm thick), which practically stop further air oxidation for years. The mechanism of the initial oxidation stage of the modified layers seems to vary with the type of surface (i.e., either nitrides or carbides). However, in any case the protection ability of the formed oxidation products is excellent, probably due to the close match between these compounds and the underlying nitrides or carbides.},

An increase in the lattice parameter of the UN2/$\alpha$-U2N3 phase was observed as the reaction temperature increased, corresponding to a continuous removal of nitrogen. Electron density calculations for these two compounds using XRD powder patterns of the samples utilizing charge-flipping technique were performed for the first time to visualize the decrease in nitrogen level as a function of temperature. Complete decomposition of UN2 into $\alpha$-U2N3 at 675 °C and the UN formation after a partial decomposition of $\alpha$-U2N3 at 975 °C were also identified in this study. The activation energy for the decomposition of the UN2/$\alpha$-U2N3 phase into UN, 423.8 ± 0.3 kJ/mol (101.3 kcal/mol), was determined under an inert argon atmosphere and is reported here experimentally for the first time.},

The candidates considered in this study were UN, U3Si2, U3Si5, and a composite material composed of UN–U3Si2. With the spark plasma sintering (SPS) method, it was possible to fabricate samples of UN with varying porosity, as well as a high-density composite of UN–U3Si2 (10{\%}). Using thermogravimetry in air, the oxidation behaviors of each material and the various microstructures of UN were assessed. These results reveal that it is possible to fabricate UN to very high densities using the SPS method, such that its resistance to oxidation can be improved compared to U3Si5 and UO2, and compete favorably with the principal ATF candidates, U3Si2, which shows a particularly violent reaction under the conditions of this study, and the UN–U3Si2 (10{\%}) composite.},

Static steam autoclave tests were performed at 300 °C and 9 MPa for period of 0.5–1.5 hours. Microstructural analyses of UN pellets show that, in a high-pressure atmosphere, the fuel collapses principally by intergranular cracking generated by the precipitation of an oxide phase in the grain boundaries. This mechanism leads to a premature mechanical collapse of the fuel pellet, exposing fresh surfaces to steam, and ultimately accelerating the oxidation process. Increasing density (specifically eliminating open porosity) was found to delay the oxidation process, while increasing grain size was found to accelerate the degradation process due to a greater susceptibility to mechanical fracture by way of intergranular oxidation. The performance of the UN-10{\%}U3Si2 composite proved to be better when compared to UN. The U...},

However, the reaction could not be carried to completion, and the presence of uranium sesquinitride and higher uranium oxides or uranium oxynitrides in the solid residue is indicated. Evolution of elemental nitrogen was seen in connection with very high reaction rates.

Starting with the production of uranium nitride and sesquinitrides up to mixed plutonium uranium nitrides, today's developments are inert nitride matrix materials to burn plutonium or to transmute long-lived actinides in accelerator-driven sub-critical systems (ADS) or fast reactors (FR). Several authors proposed zirconium nitride as possible inert matrix material for this reason. Mixed zirconium nitrides can be fabricated by carbothermal nitridation of the oxides in a narrow temperature window. Obtaining high quality material with low carbon and oxygen content is still the major challenge. Producing mixed nitride fuels by special shaping methods, as for example direct coagulation casting or freeze drying, in comparison to conventional powder compaction enables to use this material in special shapes to optimize burn up.The history of nitride fuels at PSI will be shown up to today's CONFIRM project, dealing with plutonium zirconium nitride fuels.},
